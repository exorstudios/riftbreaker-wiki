# Information

The Riftbreaker engine requires material files for any kind of texture used in the game, even for a GUI text to appear.  
Any currently used material files can be found in `materials\scripts\*`.  

# Requirements
- A material file for any new used textures ( multiple textures can be written into a single file)  

{: .highlight}
For information on textures themselves, check [DDS files](../dds-files).
